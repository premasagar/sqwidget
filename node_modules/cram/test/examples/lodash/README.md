# i18n example

This example attempts to cram lodash, which is very convoluted internally.
If we can cram lodash, we can cram virtually anything. :)

To run:

1. Install cram globally: `npm install -g cram`
2. Run `bower install` from the root of this example.
3. Run `cram index.html` from the root of this example.
4. If there are no errors, it worked.
